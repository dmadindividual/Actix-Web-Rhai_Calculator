# Actix-Web Rhai Calculator

This program is a web application built with Actix-Web and Rhai. It provides two endpoints for performing basic arithmetic operations:

- **Addition**: Calculates the sum of two numbers.
- **Multiplication**: Calculates the product of two numbers.

The arithmetic operations are performed using Rhai scripts, which are evaluated on the server. The application listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` and provides a simple API for these operations.
